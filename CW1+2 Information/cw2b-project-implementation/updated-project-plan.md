# Project Plan

*For car purchase web app*

For this CO550 Web Applications module, Team 2 (Arbaaz, Mohammed, Brian) will be making a fictitious car selling website for Audi. This web app has multiple features like a database for storing car information, a login and registration system for users to wishlist and add cars to the checkout section. When an admin logs in they will be able to perform CRUD operations like adding new information or removing it (the admin view will also be different from a customer view of the web pages). There will be at least 6 cars available on the site, each will be displayed as a card on the store page. Once one option is selected, the user will be taken to a subpage where descriptive information about the car will be shown, including multimedia like images, videos. Our web system will either use MVC or MVVM architecture to for interaction with the database, and may use Razor Pages for structure. CSS styling will likely be done with Bootstrap, which will create responsive elements conveniently and with stability. This website will offer 6 cars under the Audi brand - the RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6, RS7, R8. The selection will be limited to this brand because this website is designed for a specific customer base who are interested in Audis, and to create a consistent theme. The cars offered will be new and not used ones. We aim to have around 11 pages which consist of: store page, wishlist, checkout, login, sign-up, (6) car pages. As we practise using the C# database-related languages and frameworks, we will be building this software with waterfall methodology in mind. The cars featured can be searched through alphabetically, or filtered through by price or date added on the store page.
